# River Stream Stats

This site is built with the viewer in mind. As an avid viewer and streamer myself, I believe in giving everyone the best experience possible when it comes to finding streamers that you want to follow. River gives users an easy way to look at a variety of streamers and get a quick glimpse at their content, which differs based on if the streamer is currently streaming or is offline. If they are online, users are shown their stream in an embedded window, while offline streamers have their most recent VOD and its date shown.

## How to use River

To use River, navigate to the stream search page, enter a search term, and how many results you want to be shown at most. When you click search, you will be shown a list of all streamers within the search limit that match your query.
